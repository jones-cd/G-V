Hi Emma,

Here is my test submission.

My plan was to start mobile first, building each section as I went and getting the functionality working as I went.

In reality, when I realised I would run out of time, I decided to ensure all the HTML was in place.
Notes:

• I began with an HTML template (https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryit.asp?filename=tryw3css_templates_startup) 
so there is a link to an external css file. Given time I would transferred relevant styles to my local 
css file and removed this link
• My work is mobile based and there are not media queries in place to handle larger screen sizes
• The slider does not display or function correctly (images were corrupt so I've added urls for external images)
• The fonts do not all display correctly
• I'm aware that many styles for position need refining. 
If I had got the fonts displaying correctly I would have beenable to do this.
• I could not get svg images to accept the 'fill' attribute to change their colours, so some are not correct colour.
• There is an error that prevents my contact form from displaying
• The contact form itself is unfinished (I've just added sample text for speed)
